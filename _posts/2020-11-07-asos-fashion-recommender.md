title: Building a fashion recommender using TensorFlow/Keras
categories: [datascience]

As part of the Data Science Festival 2020, I attended an online workshop held by ASOS which walked through how to build a fashion recommender using TensorFlow/Keras. Recommender systems help users find something good for them from a number of movies, songs or products.
