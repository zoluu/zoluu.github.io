In this episode, Bia and I discuss what zombie statistics are, why it is hard for zombie statistics facts to die and whether it is right for a wrong statistc to be cited even if it produces positive effects.

Zombie statistics can be defined as statistics that no matter how many times are disproven or questioned, keep coming back and just don't die. I quiz Bia on identifying the facts and zombie statistics:

- One in four people suffer from mental illness or depression.
- You need to drink eight glasses of water a day.
- People use only 10% of their brains.
- You need to walk 10,000 steps a day to stay healthy and fit.
- The ban of plastic strwas will massively reduce plastic waste in our oceans.
