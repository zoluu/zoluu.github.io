Today, Bia and I release episode one of our podcast, How 2 rob a bank. The podcast aims to raise awareness of mathematics in the real world despite the "when will this ever be useful" comment everyone (including me) has made to their maths teacher at school. We will cover topics such as mathematics, data science, philosophy and human nature. 

### Episode One - How 2 make a decision
